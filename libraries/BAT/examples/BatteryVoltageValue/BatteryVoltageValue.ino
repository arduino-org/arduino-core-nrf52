  Written by Jeff Wu (jeff@arduino.org)
  This example for the Arduino Primo board shows how to use
  bat library.

  This example allows you to get Battery Voltage Value of Primo
  board, disabling STM32 enter to standby mode to avoid Primo board 
  enter to standby mode when Primo board is powered only by battery.
  Primo board is able to send voltage value over serial port or BLE serial, 
  Create UART service compatible with Nordic's *nRF Toolbox* and Adafruit's 
  *Bluefruit LE* iOS/Android apps. You can also use another board with 
  serial_client example in File->Examples->BLE->Central menu to set up
  a BLE serial connection between two different boards.
  This example code is in the public domain.
