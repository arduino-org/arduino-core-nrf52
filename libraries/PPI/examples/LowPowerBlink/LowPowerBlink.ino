  This example for the Arduino Primo board shows how to use
  PPI library.
  With this library is possible to bind an action to a particular
  event. In this way, when an event occurs, the related peripheral
  can take the specified action without the MCU intervention.
  For a complete list of all events and actions that is possible to
  use, please refer to the library documentation.
 
  This example code is in the public domain.

#include <PPI.h>
#include <LowPower.h>

void setup() {
  //bind a timer event to the toggle of the pin
  //set an interval for the timer (in milliseconds)
  PPI.setTimerInterval(1000);
  //select the output pin
  PPI.setOutputPin(LED_BUILTIN);
  //bind TIMER event to PIN_TOGGLE action
  PPI.setShortcut(TIMER, PIN_TOGGLE);
  
  //put the board in standby mode to save power
  //use constant latency to have a constant response from PPI action
  LowPower.standby(0, NULL, CONST_LATENCY); 
}


void loop() {}
